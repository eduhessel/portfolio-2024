During his first job at Smartbrain, I had the opportunity to extensively mentor him, teaching him not only design principles but also critical programming skills, including HTML, JavaScript, Python, and React. Edu made significant contributions to the Smartbrain Advisor Design System and played a key role in developing prototypes for our platform and various products for clients like Banco Bradesco and Banco Master. His logical thinking is excellent, and he quickly mastered color usage in design. As a design manager, I found myself learning more about the product with Edu than with many others on the team. üé®‚öîÔ∏èüíö #designer #crypto #wealth #datavisualization",
